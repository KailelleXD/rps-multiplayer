# Rock Paper Scissors GO!

## Motivation
This project is being created for a homework assignnment through my UCLAx coding bootcamp. My primary motivation beyond the due date on Oct. 11th is a genuine interest in learning how to work with firebase as well as learning how to structure code to focus on multiplayer aspects to serve as a solid foundation in my growth as a developer.

### Technology Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Firebase

### User Story:
1. Page loads and user sees the welcome screen w/instructions and a textbox to enter their name.
    * A nice green _GO_ button sits in the bottom right corner of the panel.
2. The user enters their name and _clicks_ the _GO_ button.
3. The page is replaced with the _Main Game Screen_ and _Chat Panel_ (on the right-hand side)
    * The _Chat Panel_ will also contin additional game information.
    * It currently reads:
        * ~ Please check this _Chat Panel_ for additional game information!
        * ~ Player 1: Steve, has joined the game!
        * ~ Waiting for Player 2...
4. After a brief moment the _Chat Panel_ updates with the message:
    * ~ Player 2: Mark, has joined the game!
5. The two players share a brief 'hello' and our user then _clicks_ the _Ready Button_.
6. The _Ready Button_ turns _Yellow_ to prompt Player 2 to also click ready.
7. The _Chat Panel_ updates with the message:
    * ~ Player 1: Steve, is ready!
    * ~ Waiting on Player 2!
8. This is quickly followed by:
    * ~ Player 2: Mark, is ready!
    * ~ Both players are ready.
    * ~ Game Start!
9. The _Ready Button_ turns _Green_.
10. The _Top Display Panel_ displays __ROCK__ followed by __PAPER__ then __SCISSORS__ and finally __GO!__ (with the background turning green).
11. Both players only have a second to respond, so our player quickly _clicks_ __ROCK__.
12. An _image_ of a __ROCK__ appears on the left-hand side in the _Player 1 Panel_.
    * This is simultaneous with Player 2's choice of __SCISSORS__ whose _image_ appears on the right hand-side in the _Player 2 Panel_.
13. In the _Winner Panel_ The game displays the message, "Player 1 Wins!"
14. The score totals are updated.
15. The _Ready Button_ returns to its default _Gray_ color.
16. The _Chat Panel_ updates with the message:
    * ~ Waiting for Players...
17. The two players chat some more and then play a few more rounds before saying 'goodbye' and closing their browser tabs.
